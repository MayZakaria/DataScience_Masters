    "## 1. Topic Proposal:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Our project is a predictive machine learning project on a dataset containing information about employee satisfaction, considering multiple factors such as salary, years of experience, education level, and many other factors. The dataset focuses mainly on specific types of employees such as data scientists, data engineers, database administrators, and data/business analysts. However, this analysis can be applied to any type of employee, considering many factors to measure their satisfaction.\n",
    "In addition, we found this dataset interesting as data-related jobs have recently become the most important, and many companies seek data specialists and would like to measure their satisfaction considering the current international market.\n",
    "\n",
    "During our analysis, we used Apache PySpark and the Spark ML library (data frame/dataset-based) to build predictive machine learning models. Apache PySpark and Spark ML library are used in conjunction with Hadoop distributed systems. This means that if we had a larger dataset of the same data, our project would still be applicable as we could store this large dataset on Hadoop and then use the Apache Spark data processing engine and run the same Spark Machine Learning models saved with these large datasets without any modification in the code. In other words, Spark ML models can be trained, saved, and reloaded in different Spark instances for use in predictions. As is standard in the industry, the model will eventually need to be retrained with new data to maintain its predictive power depending on the application. Some models must be retrained daily, others every month, and others only every few months. In our report, we have used Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression models. This report could help companies avoid the financial and operational costs associated with high employee turnover by using our predictive models so that they can take steps to enhance employee satisfaction and retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other side, if the models are used for risk management, the predictive model's accuracy may decrease over time due to the changes in the workplace caused by proactive measures taken to increase employee satisfaction. For instance, when the company addresses the dissatisfaction factors and starts to improve these factors, it will modify the data patterns on which the model relies, leading to less accurate predictions. Therefore, to mitigate this risk, this company should retrain its models regularly based on the evolving data which leads to new actions to be considered to increase employee satisfaction. As a result, the Spark ML models remain effective in enhancing employee satisfaction and retention."

    "### 1.2 Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The original dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phuchuynguyen/datarelated-developers-survey-by-stack-overflow \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset consists of 13 features, a mix of numerical and categorical features, and a binary target variable indicating whether the employee is satisfied, leading to a binary classification task. This dataset is processed from the Stack Overflow Annual Survey results from 2017 to 2020, however, after the EDA and data preprocessing phases we ended up analyzing 2019 and 2020 when the COVID-19 virus appeared. We will find in the provided URL above that there are two files: survey_final.csv and processed_data_toDummies.csv. The first file \"survey_final.csv\" contains the original dataset that comes from the Stack overflow Annual Developers Survey, only considering the respondents who considered themselves already in a data-related job (Data Scientist, Machine Learning Specialist, Database Administrator, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, and Data Engineer). The second file \"processed_data_toDummies.csv,” which we have proceeded with in our project, contains the data pre-processed from the original dataset with all the developer types converted into dummy variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Scientist or Machine Learning Specialist\n",
    "* Database Administrator\n",
    "* Data Analyst\n",
    "* Business Analyst and Data Engineer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before describing our dataset features we added the \"Region\" feature to our dataset because we had 180 countries so we have decided to categorize these countries into 5 regions only: Africa, Europe, America, Asia, and Oceania. Encoding 180 countries is redundant and may lead to a reduction in the accuracy of our models. Each row in the dataset consists of 15 features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Year* (integer): the year in which data or survey responses were collected\n",
    "* *Hobbyist* (string): contains binary data (e.g., \"Yes\" or \"No\") indicating whether the individual considers programming or coding as a hobby\n",
    "* *ConvertedComp* (double): the annual compensation (salary) of the respondents, in the local currency of their respective countries\n",
    "* *Country* (string): the location information of the survey respondents, indicating where they are located or working\n",
    "* *EdLevel* (string): the highest level of education attained by the respondents, such as \"Bachelor's degree\" or \"Master's degree\"\n",
    "* *Employment* (string): describes the employment status or type of job arrangement the respondents have, which can include options like \"Full-time,\" \"Part-time,\" \"Freelance,\" or \"Self-employed.\"\n",
    "* *JobSat* (integer): describes the job satisfaction level of the respondents\n",
    "* *OrgSize* (string): the size of the organization or company where the respondents work, which could be categorized by the number of employees\n",
    "* *UndergradMajor* (string): the respondents' undergraduate majors or fields of study\n",
    "* *YearsCodePro* (integer): the number of years the respondents have been coding or working in a professional coding/programming capacity\n",
    "* *Data scientist or machine learning specialist*, *Database administrator*, *Data or business analyst*, *Engineer, data* (integer): these columns used to describe the *Developer type* column in our original dataset \"survey_final.csv\" and then converted to dummy variables. For instance, when *Database administrator* contains 1 as a value, the rest will be 0 which indicates this respondent works as a Database administrator\n",
    "* *Region* (string): the geographic region or area where the respondents are located, which is broader than a specific country\n",

    "This survey is conducted every year, leading to larger datasets that are suitable for big data analysis. However, we may need to change the EDA and data pre-processing phases as new features may be added. In other words, our project is applicable on the other collected surveys starting from 2021 till 2023 and these surveys can be found at: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey.\n",

    "#### Hypothesis Testing using Chi-square:\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have illustrated in the EDA phase our dataset consists of numerical and categorical variables, specifically six categorical variables. Usually, machine learning models perform better with numerical variables rather than categorical variables and some cannot deal with categorical variables directly unless preprocessing steps have been applied such as converting them into dummy variables or assigning a probability to each category for each feature. However, before applying any preprocessing steps, we would like to know which categorical features contribute to determining the target label and the Chi-Square test would help us to do this. \n",
    "\n",
    "The chi-square test is a statistical test used to determine which categorical features are the most important for predicting the target label by assuming two hypotheses: Null hypothesis and Alternative hypothesis. In our case, the null hypothesis in the chi-square test assumes that there is no association or independence between the categorical predictors and the target label, whereas the alternative hypothesis assumes that there is an association between the categorical variables and the target label. Chi-Square test provides many selection methods to decide which features to choose, We have chosen in our project the *P-value* selection method. The \"fpr\" parameter passed below to our chi-square test represents the p-value. The *\"fpr\"* chooses all features whose p-values are below a threshold (0.05), thus controlling the false positive rate of selection. In other words, if the p-value is below the predefined significance level (0.05), then we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. This indicates that the results are statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we will start by encoding our categorical features using StringIndexer() and then combine all these features into a single dense vector column called features using VectorAssembler(). Then we pass this vector column to ChiSqSelector() with fpr value equal to 0.05."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.5.1 Pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "We have demonstrated in the EDA section when we used the \"group by\" query to group our dataset by target, we found that 12515 samples belong to class \"1\" and 6463 samples belong to class \"0\" thus we have an imbalanced target variable dataset. Since our class label distribution is skewed, leading to biased results, we balanced our data to have more accurate and precise results from our models. We have many techniques to balance our dataset but the most popular one is *Data Sampling*. Data sampling can be done using oversampling techniques or undersampling techniques or using both together, we have chosen to do oversampling to make use of HDFS and Apache spark characteristics in our big data analysis journey. Oversampling is done by duplicating the number of data points that belong to the minority class, which is in our case class 0, to match the the number of the majority class samples (class 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "The second pre-processing step is One-hot encoding, which is a technique used to convert categorical variables to a vector form that our machine-learning model can understand. In other words, each category will be a binary feature indicating whether or not the sample belongs to that category.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The third and the last step in the pre-processing phase is Scaling numerical variables. Now our data is partially ready to be passed to the Spark ML models, as they are presented in numerical values but in different ranges. Some have large values and some have small values so we can say that our data is *heterogeneous* which means one feature can be between 0-1 range and another one can be between 50-100 range. Feeding our Spark ML models with a wide range of values per feature will affect some models' performance so we will scale each feature by letting each one vary roughly within the same range, thus our data will be *homogenous*. Scaling is the process of transforming the data within a specific range, this range is usually between 0 and 1. We will apply the Min-Max Scaling technique, which is most of the time the go-to technique to scale the data. It scales the data within a specified range where the minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 1, [0,1] is the default range of the MinMaxScaler, these values could be changed but we will leave them as they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.5.2 Machine learning models\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to use the Spark ML library (dataframe/dataset-based) rather than the MLlib (RDD-based) library due to its ease of use by providing high levels of APIs, seamlessly integrating with dataframe and SQL API, adding the models to a pipeline - MLlib models cannot be added to a pipeline and many more rich features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spark ML library contains many models for classification, we have used three of them as it is unknown ahead of time which model type may be most suitable ahead of time. We started with Random Forest followed by Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. We have used L1 regularization in the Logistic Regression model to reduce the risk of overfitting and this is due to its ability to perform in-model feature selection. In other words, L1 regularization excludes the features that contribute little to the model's predictive power by setting the weights of less important features to zero. In addition, it becomes more beneficial after applying one hot encoded, as many binary columns are the result, so it excludes unnecessary binary columns that might not significantly contribute to the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We utilized a random search approach for tuning the three models and a hold-out validation technique to validate our models which is the process of splitting the dataset into three subsets: the training set, the validation set, and the testing set. The training set is used to train our machine learning model, the validation set is used for tuning our model's hyperparameters and the test set is to evaluate our model's performance. We set aside 20% of training and validation data for evaluating models' hyperparameters tuning. The holdout validation technique is the best way to consider when you have a large dataset so you can split it into three sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we trained the best-performing model on the training data using the best set of parameters we reached and then calculated the accuracy on the test dataset."

This fraction calculates the count of instances for target label '1' divided by an arbitrary factor (2.12), we reached this factor after many trials, and then divided by the count of instances for target label '0'. In the end, an oversampled dataframe is created with additional instances with a target label of '0'. Thus the class label distribution is balanced by increasing the minority class."

Random Forests is considered a supervised learning technique. One of its biggest advantages is that it can be used for regression and classification as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests works by comprising the maximum number of decision trees so it ends with a strong and accurate forest. Random Forests are considered an ensemble method that is based on bagging or bootstrapping + aggregating. How it internally works is that it builds multiple decision trees on bootstrapped subsamples of the data. Afterward, a subset of the columns also is chosen in each tree. The tree is built and the response variable with the highest decision with the most votes is chosen. By aggregating or choosing the number of columns arbitrary feature selection comes in included implicitly. What makes the random forest classifier our first chosen algorithm, regardless of the pre-processing steps made on the dataset, to detect whether this employee is satisfied or not is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Random forest produces the output with high accuracy because it does not depend on the output of one decision tree only but uses the voting technique, meaning most class labels dominant.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Random forest avoids overfitting, if one decision tree is biased because of missing values or outliers, the other decision tree will balance this by ensuring the diversity within the samples so that each tree is different from the other in terms of features and data due to the bagging method thus the trees are not dependent on each other hence less prone to overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "* Random forest can handle missing values by substituting these null values with the mean or the median value per feature so this corrects the bias problem\n",
    "\n",
    "* Random Forest provides feature selection which shows the features that mostly contribute to the classification/prediction by calculating the importance score of the feature and the features with low importance could be removed to improve the overall model performance. And this step can be made in the future to emphasize our chi-square test results. \n",

    "### 3. Summary and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, we have processed the results from the \"Stack Overflow Annual Developers Survey\" from 2017 to 2020 to predict whether the employee is satisfied with his job. We started by exploring the dataset in the EDA section by getting familiar with our numerical and categorical variables, followed by the hypothesis testing section. The target of the hypothesis testing is to identify which categorical factors affect employee satisfaction, and it was illustrated that the *Region*, *Education Level*, and *Organization Size* contribute to the prediction of employee satisfaction. Furthermore, we pre-processed our dataset by balancing it using an oversampling technique due to having an imbalanced target variable, applying one-hot encoding to the categorical features, and then scaling the numerical features. The last step in the pre-processing phase was dropping the irrelevant features from our analysis and creating a vector assembler to be passed to our models. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we are ready to build our predictive models, but first, we folded the dataset into three folds: training, validation, and testing sets. Next, we started running our random forest model, followed by naive bayes and logistic regression models using the training and validation sets. However, the results were not satisfying, so we considered all the categorical variables instead of the only three resulting from the chi-square test to compare the models' performance in terms of accuracy and time efficiency. Nevertheless, the performance degradation was relatively modest. Moreover, the models' complexity has increased, affecting their performance and interpretability. Thus, we continued our analysis but only used the resulting features from the chi-square test. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our target is to build a suitable Spark ML model to predict whether the employee is satisfied or not with his job by making the best use of the provided capabilities: HDFS and Apache Spark. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3 Challenges And Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of identifying which model to proceed with was not easy, it can be considered one of the challenges that we have encountered during our big data analysis journey. We can see that when using the accuracy metric on the Naive Bayes algorithm, considering the three categorical features resulting from the chi-square test yields a result of 55%, while using all the categorical features yields 53%. We believe that it is the worst-performing model due to its naive assumptions. Regarding the Logistic Regression model, it yielded a very low accuracy, which is 56% using the categorical features resulting from the chi-square test and 55% using all the categorical features. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also see that the Random Forest yielded the highest accuracy, with a result of 69% using both datasets, resulting from the chi-square test and the whole categorical features. Interestingly, both datasets performed equally well in terms of accuracy with the random forest, however, the time taken to train our model increased when we considered all our categorical features, and this is due to the increased model's complexity. This means that the algorithm was able to classify regardless of the extra features added. This is what makes the random forest classifier the best-suited algorithm since it performs with high accuracy, avoids bias and overfitting, and can handle large amounts of features and data so it will predict/classify the output accurately. Lastly, we applied random forest to our test set, and it achieved an accuracy of 72%, which is high compared to the previously mentioned models. We expected to get a higher value, but this could be due to our second challenge, hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth mentioning that the performance of our models could be better, however, this could be due to our hyperparameter tuning process needing to be more robust, such as the grid search method. Unfortunately, this was limited by how many random searches we could perform. The number of random searches was limited, specifically while running the random forest algorithm, as an error occurred when we increased the number of trees and the maximum tree depth during a large number of random searches, leading to a \"Java heap space\" error, indicating an out-of-memory issue that required session restarts.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the first trial to tune our random forest model, using a tree number of 200 and a maximum depth of 20, the time consumed was approximately 8 minutes, which is relatively high compared to the last attempt. In the last attempt, while tuning the random forest algorithm, the time consumed was 0.70 minutes with a tree number of 60 and a maximum depth of 20. Moving to the time consumed by the Logistic Regression model, while applying hyperparameter tuning, it was 0.72 minutes, which is relatively close to the time taken during the last attempt of the random forest model but with a lower accuracy result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mentioned parameters of the random forest model play a huge role in incrementing the training and testing time of the model, so for example, the more trees the slower our learner is, which will increase the accuracy. The same applies to the maximum depth, if the number of levels increases per tree, this will increase the training time for each tree, hence the whole forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.4 Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, our project is transferable to different domain-specific areas other than merely predicting employee satisfaction in the field of data analytics, as it could be utilized in a wide array of different aspects of different fields. Our model could be replicated using different programming languages, such as Scala which could be a task for the future. Also, more complex algorithms, such as deep learning techniques, could capture the high dimensionality of the data and provide better metrics. The downside of these algorithms is their black box techniques, which could be difficult to grasp and explain to the business side. Also, deep learning requires high computational power, making it an optimal choice to take advantage of the available capabilities within HDFS and Apache Spark. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we propose for future reports and analyses to try to incorporate other hyperparameter tuning techniques and maybe explore which ensemble methods such as Xg-Boost and AdaBoost may perform better than random forests for such datasets."
