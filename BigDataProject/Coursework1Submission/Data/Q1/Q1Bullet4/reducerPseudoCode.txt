Initialize empty lists for dry_bulb_temp_values, relative_humidity_values, and wind_speed_values
  Initialize n as 0

  For each line in standard input:
      Split line into date and values by tab as a delimiter
      Split values by comma as a delimiter
      Convert values to floats and store in dry_bulb_temp, relative_humidity, and wind_speed

      Append dry_bulb_temp sub-values to dry_bulb_temp_values main list
      Append relative_humidity sub-values to relative_humidity_values main list
      Append wind_speed sub-values to wind_speed_values main list

      Increment n by 1

      Calculate sums of each column/list (dry_bulb_temp_values, relative_humidity_values, and wind_speed_values)

      Calculate sums of products between columns

      Calculate sums of squares for each column

      Calculate the correlation coefficients:
          correlation_matrix = 3x3 matrix
          Fill the matrix with appropriate values based on the provided formula using the sums and n

  Output the correlation matrix:
      For each row in correlation_matrix:
          Print elements of the row separated by tab
