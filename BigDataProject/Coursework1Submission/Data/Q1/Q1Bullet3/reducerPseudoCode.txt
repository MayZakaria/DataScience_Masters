  Initialize variables: current_date, total_dew_point_temp, total_squared_dew_point_temp, count = 0

  For each line in standard input:
      Split the line by tab as a delimiter
      Extract 'Date' and 'Dew Point Temp' values
      Convert 'Dew Point Temp' to float

      If current_date is None:
          Set current_date to the extracted date

      If current_date is different from the extracted date:
          Calculate average and variance for the current date
          Print date as a key, average and variance as value for the previous date

          Reset variables for the new date

      Update total_dew_point_temp, count, and total_squared_dew_point_temp for the current date

  Calculate and output the average and variance for the last date
