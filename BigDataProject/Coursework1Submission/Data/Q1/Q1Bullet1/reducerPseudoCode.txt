    Initialize variables: current_date, min_wind_speed = infinity, max_wind_speed = negative infinity

    For each line in standard input:
        Split the line by tab as a delimiter
        Extract 'Date' and 'Wind Speed' values
        Convert 'Wind Speed' to an integer

        If current_date is None:
            Set current_date to the extracted date

        If current_date is different from the extracted date:
            Print the date as a key and the difference between max_wind_speed and min_wind_speed for the previous date as a value

            Reset current_date, min_wind_speed, and max_wind_speed for the new date

        Update min_wind_speed and max_wind_speed with the extracted wind_speed

    Print the date as a key and difference between max_wind_speed and min_wind_speed as a value for the last date
