  Initialize variables: current_date, min_relative_humidity = infinity

  For each line in standard input:
      Split the line by tab as a delimiter
      Extract 'Date' and 'Relative Humidity' values
      Convert 'Relative Humidity' to an integer

      If current_date is None:
          Set current_date to the extracted date

      If current_date is different from the extracted date:
          Print the date as a key and the minimum relative_humidity for the previous date as a value

          Reset current_date and min_relative_humidity for the new date

      Update min_relative_humidity with the extracted relative_humidity

  Print the date and minimum relative_humidity for the last date
