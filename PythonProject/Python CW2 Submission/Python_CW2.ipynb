        "The topic of HR recruitment has been one of the hottest topics in the industry. Companies want to recruit the best talents with the least amount of spendings in order to maximize revenues. Being a data scientist in a company we have been tasked to explore what value could be added to the HR department when recruiting other data scientist aboard. HR had asked to find the most willing data scientist that have the potential to change their job in order to contact them for the job offering. We extend our general exploration from last paper and take an in-depth approach to be able to classify if a potential candidate is willing to change his job and what are the important factors that contribute to that decision. We will build our analysis on some machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and random forests. We also include the use statistical techniques such as the Chi- Squared and ANOVA tests. \n",

        "In this report there is a good investment in balancing out the dataset using undersampling and oversampling techniques and a comparison between both. We also touch on the topics of model performance based on precision, recall and the F1-score.\n",

        "Within this project, I would like to explore which features play a role in the decision of moving from a company for an employee. First of all, it is of great interest to me to extend the exploration from last report and build a more rigorous approach than just data visualizations and descriptive statistics. \n",
        "\n",
        "I focus my analysis on using hypothesis testing techniques such as the Chi-Squared and ANOVA test to select the most contributing categorical and numerical features. I explore what techniques of variable encoding is suitable for my hypothesis testing. I furthermore start to explore the problems that arise due to having an imbalanced target variable and try to balance the data using undersampling and oversampling techniques. I also compare model performance before and after balancing the data and how it is crucial to do so to get a better performing model. \n",

The dataset is a compilation of HR data which are collected by a company that offers data science specific courses. Each observation is an entry for a person enrolled in the data science course provided in the company. The company has collected many features such as *education_level*, *city_development_index, major_discipline* and others. The dataset has enrolled persons from 123 different *cities* which are indicated by city_(number), moreover each *city* (Char) has a *city_development_index* (Float)which indicates on how much the *city* is developed ranging from 0 the lowest value till 1 the highest value. The dataset however is the processed version which we have already processed in the first report in which null values have been removed, string values have been sanitized, categories have been well defined, etc. The size of the data is 19158 records before preprocessing and 9607 records after data processing and cleaning.\n",

Thus, we will have some unneeded features that will not have a significant contribution for the class label which in turn will affect our analysis results for example the performance metrics of our chosen models. Unneeded features in our dataset can sometimes let the model to misclassify the data points. When we come to the data points (rows), since we have uneeded features thus we have some data points missclassified so they won't help us during our analysis pipeline. Unfortunately they became misleading and redundant. Here comes the importance of Feature Selection Methods to help us to determine which feature has highest importance. There are 2 types of features in our dataset: categorical features and numerical features. Each type of them has different techniques to determine the feature's importance\n",

        "\n",
        "Therefore, all the continuous features are needed in our analysis but after studying well the dataset to enhance our domain knowledge we found that there is a correlation between a categorical feature which is the *city* and a numerical feature which is the *city_development_index*.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each city has a development index to indicate how much the city is developed ranging from 0 which is the lowest value to 1 which is the highest value and we have some cities that have the same development index.\n",

This is due to the fact that most instances in our model are from class 0 as our data is imbalanced. The same logic could be applied to precision.

On the other hand, the model classifies class 1 with 15% which means it only classifies 15% of the people who want to leave their jobs correctly. Again the model does not work well to identify people who want to leave their jobs. For numerical variables however we get a slight improvement in precision which means that the HR personal has a 55% chance in calling a candidate who actually wants to leave their job which is an improvement from the categorical features model. However 55% is merely better than just randomly guessing thus we need to do better. Again this is a result of the class distribution is skewed and biased towards class 0. That's why any data point is mostly classified as majority class."

        "As we can see from the above confusion matrix that the accuracy of the random forests algorithm is way better than the one of the logistic regression where random forests accuracy is 76% while logistic regression has an accuracy of 58%. It is interesting to see that our hand picked logistic regression model returns a recall for class 1 of 62% while the random forest has 22% recall. This means that the logistic regression predicts the people who would leave their jobs with a higher rate than the random forest. Both random forests and logistic regression have nearly the same percision rates.\n"

We also evaluate the different metrics and find out the logistic regression model after data balancing is the model we would suggest HR to use in order to predict the decision of candidates as it had given us the highest recall rates for both class 0 and class 1. We also find out that the chi-squared test is insensitive to imbalanced data.\n",

        "All in all, We have explored the HR dataset provided by the company in order to understand which factors affect the decision of moving from the current job and building a predictive model to classify candidates. We have at first chosen which features contribute to the prediction of a candidates' decision using hypothesis testing. Next, we started running our two machine learning models which are logistic regression and random forests on the unbalanced data to show how bad the model performs on it. Furthermore, we balance the data using undersampling and oversampling techniques. Lastly, we re-run our models and compare the metrics to before doing the balancing of data. "
