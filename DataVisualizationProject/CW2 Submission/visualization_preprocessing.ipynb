       "   Flexible work arrangements  Making a positive impact or difference in people's lives To what extent do you feel that your current job helps you to achieve a healthy work-life balance (meeting up with friends, playing sports, reading books, doing a hobby, meeting up with family members)? To what extent do feel that management/supervisor support (such as encouraging personal time off and work breaks, setting reasonable workloads) influences your work-life balance? What is the work arrangement type you prefer/wish for your current job? What is your current work arrangement type for your job? To what extent do you think that your current work arrangement provides you with the resources and tools needed that help you to fulfill your job effectively? (Example: you were given a MyFi/Mobile Bundle while working from home, while working from the office it's calm and quiet which helps you focus on your daily tasks)  \\\n",
